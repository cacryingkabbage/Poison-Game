Game Instructions:
The game is supposed to be a gamble. You are presented with two poisons. 
You manage your health and your timer which counts down, having to drink from two poisons that could damage you slightly or massively. If you reach 0 Health or if the Timer runs out, you lose.
However, there is a chance you can drink a poison that grants more health or more time. The goal is to survive for as long as possible.
